I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Prof. Yuan and the entire team @ AIM Group for believing in my potential and welcoming me into this warm and inclusive family. -->

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently studying Automation @ Tongji Univ. and working on AI4Medical. Undergraduate graduation in 2025 (with focus on mechatronics, AI, and robotics in the medical field).
- üå± I mainly focus on AI4Medical, Biomedical Engineering, Intelligent Medical Robotics (aiming to reach the level 5 (standard of automation proposed by *Prof. [Guang-Zhong Yang (RAE Fellow (FREng), Fellow of IEEE, IET, AIMBE, IAMBE, MICCAI)](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/en/po_facultyv/532.html)*, and Medical Image Analysis. From a technical perspective, I hope to combine **mechanism intelligence** and **algorithm intelligence** (proposed by *Prof. [Jian S. Dai (MAE, RAE Fellow (FREng), Fellow of IEEE, ASME, RSA, IMechE, CAA, CEng)](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/jian.dai/)* together.
- 
- I hope to discuss, communicate, and cooperate with friends, especially peers with backgrounds in artificial intelligence, clinical medicine, mechatronics, and mechanism and machine theory under the concept of 'From the doctors, by the engineers, for the patients.' (proposed by *Prof. [Junbo Ge, (Fellow of CAS, ESC, ACC, AHA, one of the leading cardiologists in the world)](https://ibs.fudan.edu.cn/ab/33/c21163a240435/page.htm)*.
