### Hi there my No.![visitor count](https://profile-counter.glitch.me/Metaphysicist0/count.svg) visitor.

### I'm Tianliang Yao @ Tongji Univ.

 (Dept of Control Science and Engineering, Supervisor: Prof. [Peng Qi](https://cse.tongji.edu.cn/6b/68/c15581a158568/page.htm)).

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently studying Automation @ Tongji Univ. and working on AI4Medical. Undergraduate graduation in 2025.
- üå± I mainly focus on AI4Medical, Biomedical Engineering, Intelligent Medical Robotics (aiming to reach the level 5 (standard of automation proposed by *Prof. [Guang-Zhong Yang (RAE Fellow (FREng), Fellow of IEEE, IET, AIMBE, IAMBE, MICCAI)](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/en/po_facultyv/532.html)*, and Medical Image Analysis. From a technical perspective, I hope to combine **mechanism intelligence** and **algorithm intelligence** (proposed by *Prof. [Jian S. Dai (MAE, RAE Fellow (FREng), Fellow of IEEE, ASME, RSA, IMechE, CAA, CEng)](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/jian.dai/)* together.
- 
- I hope to discuss, communicate, and cooperate with friends, especially peers with backgrounds in artificial intelligence, clinical medicine, mechatronics, and mechanism and machine theory under the concept of 'From the doctors, by the engineers, for the patients.' (proposed by *Prof. [Junbo Ge, (Fellow of CAS, ESC, ACC, AHA, one of the leading cardiologists in the world)](https://ibs.fudan.edu.cn/ab/33/c21163a240435/page.htm)*.
