### Hi there my No.![visitor count](https://profile-counter.glitch.me/Metaphysicist0/count.svg) visitor.

### I'm Tian-Liang Yao @ Tongji Univ.
### (Dept of Control Science and Engineering, Supervisor: Prof. [Peng Qi](https://cse.tongji.edu.cn/6b/68/c15581a158568/page.htm))!

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently studying Automation @ Tongji Univ. and working on AI4Medical. Undergraduate graduation in 2025.
- üå± I mainly focus on AI4Medical, Biomedical Engineering, Intelligent Medical Robotics (to reach level 5 (standard proposed by Prof. [Guang-Zhong Yang](https://imr.sjtu.edu.cn/en/po_facultyv/532.html)), and Medical Image Analysis.
- 
- What do I want to do?
- 
- In the field of intelligent medical robotics, I hope to combine **machine intelligence** and **algorithm intelligence** together.
-
- Regarding **machine intelligence**, metamorphic mechanism (a wonderful theory proposed by Prof. [Jian S. Dai](https://sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/daijiansheng.html)  (some delicate devices, including mitral valve clamps and valves for TAVR, are all possible directions where metamorphic mechanism can be utilized) and continuum/soft robotic structures are interesting and prosperous.
-
- For **algorithm intelligence**, semantic analysis of surgical scenes, imitation learning of surgeon skills, surgical planning and decision-making, and intelligent control theory are all vital. I am also eager to leverage machine learning algorithms to mine hidden patterns in the fusion of multi-source/multi-modality biomedical data. This is also an important part of the proposed *algorithm intelligence*.
-
- I hope to discuss, communicate, and cooperate with friends, especially peers with backgrounds in artificial intelligence, clinical medicine mechatronics, and  mechanism and machine theory!
